## FAQs

### Can I download private videos?

The rule of thumb is this: If you have access to the video - aka you are able to watch the video in your browser, you can download it. If it requires a password you don't have, and you are not able to watch the video you canno't download it.

### How many videos can I download?

Once you purchase the our downloader extension, you have access to it and future upgrades for life - you can download as many videos as you want.

### Do you track what I download?

No. Everything happens locally on your computer and is not sent to our servers.

### Where are the downloads saved?

The videos are saved to whatever folder you have set to download to in your browser's settings. Usually this is your Downloads folder by default.

### How long does it take to download?

It depends on the size of the video you are trying to download and your internet speed (among other things). Most videos download very quickly, but longer videos (hours more) and higher resolutions will increase download times

### Is my data private?

All detection and conversion happen locally. Only licence checks touch our servers. No viewing history or passwords are stored.

We recommend using our [SERP VPN](https://serp.ly/serp-vpn) extension to hide your IP and location.

### Is this legal?

**DISCLAIMER:** We are not attorneys and do not offer legal advice. Laws vary by country and platform. For any legal question please consult a qualified legal professional.

We give you full control over download speeds because we believe users should decide how they use their software.

That said, here are a few widely accepted best practices for safe, responsible downloading:

1.  Only download content you created, own, or have explicit permission from the rights holder to access.
2.  Protect your personal data by respecting platform rules and rate limits with reasonable download speeds to avoid automated abuse systems putting your account at risk.
3.  Protect your privacy by using a reputable VPN for IP protection before initiating downloads — [this is the VPN we recommend & use](https://serp.ly/best/vpn).

### Do you offer refunds?

See our [refund policy](https://github.com/serpapps/legal/blob/main/refund-policy.md) for the most up-to-date answer to that question. TLDR: Our downloaders work. If you have a problem with something not working, we will fix it or give you a refund.

### It says “No video found” — what do I do?

Try:

1. Reloading the page & clicking play on the video so that it can play for a few seconds before clicking the extension.
2. Using a VPN (some regions hide media files)
